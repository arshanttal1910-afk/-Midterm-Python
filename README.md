The Baseball Team Manager is a structured, console-based Python application developed to demonstrate object-oriented design, data persistence, and clean separation of concerns. The system enables users to manage a baseball team lineup by performing operations such as displaying players, adding new players, removing existing players, rearranging lineup order, and updating player positions and statistics. Each player’s batting average is calculated dynamically and displayed with precise formatting to three decimal places.

The application persists data using a CSV file and leverages dictionary-based file handling to ensure reliable storage and retrieval of player information. It incorporates robust input validation to maintain data integrity, including enforcing valid positions and preventing invalid statistical entries. Additionally, the program enhances usability by displaying the current date, accepting a future game date in standardized YYYY-MM-DD format, and calculating the number of days remaining until the next game when applicable.

The project architecture is modular and follows best practices in software design. The objects.py file contains core business logic and class definitions, db.py manages data access and storage, ui.py handles user interaction and formatted console output, and main.py coordinates overall program execution. This structured design promotes maintainability, readability, scalability, and adherence to professional programming standards.
